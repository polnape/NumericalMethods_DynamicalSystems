# Numerical Methods for Dynamical Systems

This repository contains a collection of simulations and numerical analyses carried out as part of the Master's course *Numerical Methods for Dynamical Systems*. It explores a variety of nonlinear dynamical systems and mathematical models, originally implemented in Python and later continued in MATLAB for improved efficiency in prototyping and visualization.

> **Note**: The code is not designed to be executed or reproduced directly. Instead, the aim is to provide a clear overview of how each problem was approached and solved computationally. The scripts are meant to illustrate the numerical methods applied and offer intuitive insight into the modeling strategies used.

## 🔍 Topics Covered

- **Logistic Map**: Iterative analysis and bifurcation behavior.
- **Standard 2D Map**: Invariant curves, periodic points, and chaos.
- **Poincaré Sections**: Surface of section and first-return maps.
- **Linear Systems**: Stability classification via eigenvalues and manifolds.
- **Pendulum**: Phase portraits and heteroclinic connections.
- **Lotka–Volterra**: Predator–prey model with stability analysis.
- **Manifold Parametrization**: Graph and normal form expansion.
- **Restricted Three-Body Problem**: Homoclinic orbits via parameter tuning.
