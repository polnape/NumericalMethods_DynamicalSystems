# Numerical Methods for Dynamical Systems

This repository contains a collection of simulations and numerical analyses carried out as part of the Master's course *Numerical Methods for Dynamical Systems*. It explores a variety of nonlinear dynamical systems and mathematical models, originally implemented in Python and later continued in MATLAB for improved efficiency in prototyping and visualization.

> **Note**: The code is not designed to be executed or reproduced directly. Instead, the aim is to provide a clear overview of how each problem was approached and solved computationally. The scripts are meant to illustrate the numerical methods applied and offer intuitive insight into the modeling strategies used.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into multiple folders, each corresponding to a specific assignment or topic covered during the course.  
The final report, which compiles all the work and includes the full code for the final project, is available in the root directory as: `NMDS_PolNavarroPerez.pdf`.


## üîç Topics Covered

- **Logistic Map**: Iterative analysis and bifurcation behavior.
- **Standard 2D Map**: Invariant curves, periodic points, and chaos.
- **Poincar√© Sections**: Surface of section and first-return maps.
- **Linear Systems**: Stability classification via eigenvalues and manifolds.
- **Pendulum**: Phase portraits and heteroclinic connections.
- **Lotka‚ÄìVolterra**: Predator‚Äìprey model with stability analysis.
- **Manifold Parametrization**: Graph and normal form expansion.
- **Restricted Three-Body Problem**: Homoclinic orbits via parameter tuning.
